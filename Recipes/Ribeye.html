            Actually, it's not really that difficult to make a perfectly-cooked, well-seasoned ribeye right at home.

        <h3><em>Top tips for perfect ribeye steak at home</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Let the steak sit for 30 minute before cooking.</em>This will allow the meat to come to room tempeprature and therefore cokk more evenly.</li>
            <li><em>Get the pan HOT.</em>For a proper, caramelized sear, you need the oil and the skillet to be extremely hot. If you dont't hear an intense sizzle immediately after adding the steak, takeit out and let the pan heat for longer!</li>
            <li><em>Baste the steak with butter during the last 5 minute of cooking.</em>Butter will burn if you add it sooner. This is just the right amount of time for it to get brown and nutty.</li>
